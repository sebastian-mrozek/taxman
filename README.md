IN PROGRESS, not usable yet.

A simple web app for contractors with few customers and little complexities in expenditure.
Based on a software engineering contractor life in NZ - hence NZ tax specific.

A reason to build a Svelte app and avoid paying an accountant.

TODO:
- svelte routing
- gst view component
- withholding tax component
- provide sample data
- gst returns (based on how many periods there are)
- income tax return
- openAPI to generate both models? maybe Java => OpenAPI => Typescript?
- persistence (h2, json?)
- maybe remove Java, use Node and server-less?
